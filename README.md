# ALTAWASUL-PRICING
## üìä Umrah Hotel Pricing Analytics Dashboard 1447 AH

This project is an interactive web dashboard designed for Altawasul Global to analyze and visualize Umrah hotel prices in Makkah and Madinah for the 1447 AH season.

## üéØ Motivation

The Umrah market is highly competitive, and travel companies must make quick, data-driven decisions to price their packages effectively. Manually comparing prices from different suppliers and tracking seasonal changes is time-consuming and error-prone.

This project solves that problem by offering a centralized, interactive dashboard. The tool visualizes complex pricing data, making it easier to spot trends, compare hotels and suppliers, and uncover strategic opportunities. The goal is to empower the pricing team at Altawasul Global to make smarter, faster, and more profitable decisions.
